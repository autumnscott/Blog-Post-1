Sometimes it’s fun to pick up on different techniques that other artists are using. Often enough, we get caught up in the habitual cycle of how we’re used to doing things, and we forget to explore the vast depths of creativity.  I think it’s important to build community so that we can inspire one another and look at things through fresh eyes. With that being said, here’s a quick look at a Photoshop technique featured on the Adobe Create magazine.

The idea is to create a “looking glass” effect that lays on top of images. It’s a quick and fun way to make photographs more interesting. The effect gives the photographs a unique and transcendent look. Lucky for you, Adobe was kind enough to share this Photoshop action set with the world. Below I have provided a link that will direct you to a free download of this action set so you can try it out for yourself!

Here are some of my pieces I used Campau’s action set on. Tell me what you think! Do you like this “looking glass” effect or do you think it’s a waste of time?
